  Let's make a new dbt project in {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}. âœ¨

  and we'll have you set up in no time.

  If at any time you change your mind just Ctrl+C to cancel,
  and nothing will get created. You can also cancel and pass
  a --pretend flag to do a run-through first before the real thing.

# Post cleanup message

  Your project "{{ project_name }}" has been created successfully! ðŸŽ‰

  Next steps:

  1. Change directory to the project root:

    $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}

  2. Ensure the virtual environment is active:

    $ source {{ virtual_environment_name }}/bin/activate

  3. Run initial dbt build:

    $ dbt deps
    $ dbt build

# Tasks
_tasks:
  - "python3 -m venv {{ virtual_environment_name }}"
  - "source {{ virtual_environment_name }}/bin/activate"
  - "python3 -m pip install uv"
  - "source {{ virtual_environment_name }}/bin/activate"
  - "uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt"
